# 🚀 ShopVerse - Complete Startup Guide

## Problem Summary

Your application has the following issues:

1. **Backend Server Not Running** - The main issue causing all `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors
2. **Frontend trying to connect to localhost:5000** - But backend isn't listening
3. **Error handling issues** - Some error responses weren't properly handled

## ✅ Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed error handling in GlobalContext.jsx** - Line 158 now safely accesses error response data
2. **Improved error messages** - All API calls now have fallback error messages

## 🔧 How to Start the Application

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- MongoDB connection (already configured in .env)
- Two terminal windows/tabs

### Step 1: Start the Backend Server

Open **Terminal 1** and run:

```bash
cd /Volumes/Data\ 1/Shopp/Backend
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Server is running on ${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Keep this terminal running. The backend must be active for the frontend to work.

### Step 2: Start the Frontend Development Server

Open **Terminal 2** and run:

```bash
cd /Volumes/Data\ 1/Shopp/Frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
  VITE v6.3.5  ready in XXX ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  press h to show help
```

### Step 3: Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot GET /api/..." or "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"

**Solution:** Make sure the backend server is running in Terminal 1. Check that you see "Server is running on ${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}"

### Issue: Frontend shows blank page or errors

**Solution:** 
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify both servers are running
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
4. Refresh the page

### Issue: Port 5000 already in use

**Solution:** 
```bash
# Find process using port 5000
lsof -i :5000

# Kill the process (replace PID with the actual process ID)
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Issue: Port 5173 already in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find process using port 5173
lsof -i :5173

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
```

## 📋 API Endpoints Being Used

- `DELETE /api/products/delete-from-wishlist/:id` - Remove from wishlist

### Cart
- `GET /api/cart/get` - Get user's cart
- `POST /api/cart/add/:id` - Add product to cart
- `PATCH /api/cart/qty-inc/:id` - Increase quantity
- `PATCH /api/cart/qty-dec/:id` - Decrease quantity

## 🚨 Common Errors and Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` | Backend not running | Start backend with `npm start` |
| `Cannot read properties of undefined` | API error not handled | Already fixed in GlobalContext.jsx |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid/missing JWT token | Login again |
| `404 Not Found` | Wrong API endpoint | Check backend routes |
| `CORS error` | Frontend/backend mismatch | Verify both are running on correct ports |

## 🎓 Development Tips

### Hot Reload
- **Frontend:** Changes auto-reload (Vite)
- **Backend:** Changes auto-reload (nodemon)

### Debugging
- Use browser DevTools (F12) for frontend
- Check terminal output for backend logs
- Use `console.log()` in both frontend and backend

### Testing API Endpoints
Use tools like:
- Postman
- Thunder Client (VS Code extension)
- curl commands

Example:
```bash
curl -X GET ${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/api/products/get-products
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After starting both servers, verify:

- [ ] Backend running on ${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}
- [ ] Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
- [ ] Can access home page without errors
- [ ] Can see products loading
- [ ] Can login/signup
- [ ] Can add products to cart
- [ ] Can view wishlist
- [ ] No console errors

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?
